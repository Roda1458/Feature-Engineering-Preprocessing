# Feature Engineering and Preprocessing

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed to compute fundamental statistical metrics related to feature vectors and matrices. The project addresses key aspects of feature engineering and preprocessing by evaluating statistical properties such as mean, variance, covariance, and correlation.

### Objectives

1. **Compute the Mean and Variance of a Feature Vector**
2. **Compute the Covariance Between Two Vectors**
3. **Compute the Correlation Between Two Vectors**
4. **Compute the Covariance and Correlation Matrices for a Data Matrix**

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Mean and Variance of a Feature Vector

**Objective:** Determine the mean and variance of a one-dimensional feature vector.

**Description:**

- **Mean:** Represents the average value of the elements in the feature vector. It provides a central value around which the data points are distributed.
- **Variance:** Measures the dispersion of the elements from the mean. A higher variance indicates that the data points are more spread out from the mean, whereas a lower variance indicates that they are closer to the mean.

### 2. Covariance Between Two Vectors

**Objective:** Calculate the covariance between two one-dimensional feature vectors.

**Description:**

- **Covariance:** Quantifies the degree to which two vectors vary together. If the covariance is positive, it suggests that as one vector increases, the other tends to increase as well. Conversely, a negative covariance indicates that as one vector increases, the other tends to decrease. Covariance helps in understanding the relationship between two variables.

### 3. Correlation Between Two Vectors

**Objective:** Compute the correlation between two one-dimensional feature vectors.

**Description:**

- **Correlation:** Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two vectors. It is normalized and ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. Correlation provides a clearer picture of the linear association between variables compared to covariance.

### 4. Covariance and Correlation Matrices for a Data Matrix

**Objective:** Compute the covariance and correlation matrices for a data matrix, where each row represents a feature and each column represents a sample.

**Description:**

- **Covariance Matrix:** Shows the covariance between pairs of features. The diagonal elements represent the variances of individual features, while the off-diagonal elements represent the covariances between features. This matrix is useful for understanding the relationships and dependencies between multiple features.

- **Correlation Matrix:** Displays the correlation coefficients between pairs of features. It normalizes the covariance values, providing a standardized measure of the strength and direction of linear relationships between features. The diagonal elements are 1 (indicating perfect correlation with themselves), and the off-diagonal elements show the extent of linear relationships between different features.
